        <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Creole Seasoning</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in
            a broiler pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the
            juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
            least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate. </li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula.
            Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery. </li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken. </li>
    </ol>
